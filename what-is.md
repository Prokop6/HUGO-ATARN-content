## Background

The Asian Traditional Archery Research Network provides for mutual friendly exchange and support among the different archery traditions of Asia, and to widen appreciation worldwide of the different archery traditions of Asia.

The archery traditions of Asia (for example those of Mongolia, China, Korea, Tibet and Japan) have at one time or another enjoyed cross-fertilization and exchange of techniques (albeit sometimes on the battlefield.) Now some of these great traditions have disappeared, while others flourish, but in isolation.

The archery traditions of Asia are rich in folklore, history, artistic expression, philosophy,technique, science and technology. Some, however, are in danger. In some Asian regions, the influence of western materialistic culture threatens to cause a loss of interest among potential new exponents. Sometimes, it is the craft of the bow and arrow makers which is under threat because of the dying-out of skills or the disappearance of sources of traditional materials.

## Activities

The network carries out the following activities -</font></p>

Historical, folkloric, artistic, technical or military research on traditional Asian archery forms, with particular emphasis on
